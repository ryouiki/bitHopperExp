This mod provides several features and fixes including:

-- Web UI
http://localhost:8337/current/index.html

-- Penalty
. you can use penalty value to favor / disfavor specific pool
. For normal pools, internal round Shares are treated as : real round share x penalty
. For backup pools, internal rejection rates are treates as : rejection x penalty

-- NameCoin pools
supports BitParking and NameBit

-- Experimental, not recommended pools
. btcguild : works but the round share value is ~1 hour lagged one
. bitcoins.lc : usually they fake or delay stat
. deepbit : cannot hop properly, but you can use it by adjusting penalty

# Instructions

In order to run bithopper you need twisted phython installed:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac

Copy password.py.default to a new file called password.py then modify the new
file to include your bitcoin addresses, and pool passwords, instead of mine.

If you don't want to use a pool give it an invalid password, or go to localhost:8337/stats and switch its role to disable.

Run python bitHopper.py

It listens on localhost:8337.  So you should direct your miner to
localhost:8337.

# Windows installation

Download and install:
